MS4A1,1.3822587,B cells,B cells,This gene encodes a B-lymphocyte surface molecule which plays a role in the development and differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells.
CD79A,1.3538982,B cells,B cells,This gene encodes the Ig-alpha protein of the B-cell antigen component.
CD37,1.2156905,B cells,B cells,"CD37 (tetraspanin TSPAN26) is a B-cell surface antigen widely expressed on mature B cells, is a peripheral mature B-Cell marker."
CD79B,1.0937638,B cells,B cells,This gene encodes the Ig-beta protein of the B-cell antigen component.
CD19,1.093267,B cells,B cells,Expression of this cell surface protein is restricted to B cell lymphocytes. This protein is a reliable marker for pre-B cells but its expression diminishes during terminal B cell differentiation in antibody secreting plasma cells. 
BLNK,1.0380735,B cells,B cells,"This gene encodes a cytoplasmic linker or adaptor protein that plays a critical role in B cell development. This protein bridges B cell receptor-associated kinase activation with downstream signaling pathways, thereby affecting various biological functions."
