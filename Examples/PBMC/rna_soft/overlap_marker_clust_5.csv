CD8B,0.81499916,Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells,T cells,The CD8 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on most cytotoxic T lymphocytes that mediates efficient cell-cell interactions within the immune system.
CD8A,0.70769614,Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells,T cells,The CD8 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on most cytotoxic T lymphocytes that mediates efficient cell-cell interactions within the immune system.
CD27,0.6439747,T cells,T cells,The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor is required for generation and long-term maintenance of T cell immunity.
GZMK,0.54826707,Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells,T cells,"This gene product is a member of a group of related serine proteases from the cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells share the remarkable ability to recognize, bind, and lyse specific target cells."
KLRC1,0.5481858,NK cells,NK cells,Key inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that regulates their activation and effector functions
KLRK1,0.52810633,NK cells,NK cells,"The NKG2 gene family is located within the NK complex, a region that contains several C-type lectin genes preferentially expressed in NK cells. This gene encodes a member of the NKG2 family. "
