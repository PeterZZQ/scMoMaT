GZMK,0.98567295,Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells,T cells,"This gene product is a member of a group of related serine proteases from the cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells share the remarkable ability to recognize, bind, and lyse specific target cells."
IL7R,0.97135276,Memory T cells,T cells,The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for interleukin 7 (IL7). 
KLRD1,0.77302563,NK cells,NK cells,Key inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that regulates their activation and effector functions
KLRB1,0.770437,NK cells,NK cells,Plays an inhibitory role on natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxicity. Activation results in specific acid sphingomyelinase/SMPD1 stimulation with subsequent marked elevation of intracellular ceramide. Activation also leads to AKT1/PKB and RPS6KA1/RSK1 kinases stimulation as well as markedly enhanced T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3.
NKG7,0.761123,NK cells,NK cells,NKG7 (Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7) is a Protein Coding gene. An important paralog of this gene is LIM2.
KLRC1,0.6949491,NK cells,NK cells,Key inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that regulates their activation and effector functions
