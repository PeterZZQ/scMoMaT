GNLY,1.2605039,NK cells,NK cells,"This protein is present in cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, and it has antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis and other organisms. "
KLRD1,1.0653824,NK cells,NK cells,Key inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that regulates their activation and effector functions
NKG7,1.049013,NK cells,NK cells,NKG7 (Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7) is a Protein Coding gene. An important paralog of this gene is LIM2.
KLRF1,1.0172118,NK cells,NK cells,Involved in the natural killer (NK)-mediated cytolysis of PHA-induced lymphoblasts. 
GZMB,1.0064937,Plasmacytoid dendritic cells,Myeloid cells,"This gene encodes a member of the granzyme subfamily of proteins, part of the peptidase S1 family of serine proteases."
KLRB1,0.8912525,NK cells,NK cells,Plays an inhibitory role on natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxicity. Activation results in specific acid sphingomyelinase/SMPD1 stimulation with subsequent marked elevation of intracellular ceramide. Activation also leads to AKT1/PKB and RPS6KA1/RSK1 kinases stimulation as well as markedly enhanced T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3.
FCGR3A,0.77889055,FCGR3A+ monocytes,Myeloid cells,"This gene encodes a receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G, and it is involved in the removal of antigen-antibody complexes from the circulation, as well as other responses, including antibody dependent cellular mediated cytotoxicity and antibody dependent enhancement of virus infections."
KLRC1,0.7652425,NK cells,NK cells,Key inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that regulates their activation and effector functions
NCAM1,0.72271305,NK cells,NK cells,"This protein is also involved in the expansion of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells which play an important role in immune surveillance."
NCR1,0.6930262,NK cells,NK cells,Cytotoxicity-activating receptor that may contribute to the increased efficiency of activated natural killer (NK) cells to mediate tumor cell lysis.
